This web application is designed to help individuals plan their week more effectively and manage their time efficiently. The app provides an intuitive interface that allows users to organize their tasks, set deadlines, and visualize their schedules in a way that encourages productivity and time management. By combining multiple functionalities such as task creation, weekly planning, overdue task tracking, and real-time updates, this app ensures that users stay on top of their to-dos.

## Accessing Pages in the Web App

You can easily navigate to any of the above pages within the web app. Once logged in, use the navigation tabs at the top of the screen to switch between the **Home**, **Weekly Planner**, **Overdue Work**, and **Today's Work** pages.

## UI/UX Design

The design was created using **LucidCharts**. Originally, I developed this to replace my paper-based task organization system. After receiving frequent questions about my productivity, I decided to build this web app to make the process accessible to others.

## Data Storage

To ensure user privacy, all data is stored **locally** on the user's device.

## Feedback
