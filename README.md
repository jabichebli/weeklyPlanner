## UI/UX Design

The design was created using **LucidCharts**. Originally, I developed this to replace my paper-based task organization system. After receiving frequent questions about my productivity, I decided to build this web app to make the process accessible to others.

## Data Storage

To ensure user privacy, all data is stored **locally** on the user's device.
